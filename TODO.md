# TODO: Fix Error on /blogs Route and Secure Admin Routes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated src/components/BlogSearch.tsx to filter out blogs with missing _id or imageId before calling toString()
- [x] Updated src/app/page.tsx to filter out blogs with missing _id or imageId before calling toString()
- [x] Fixed Next.js 15 params issue in src/app/api/blogs/[id]/route.ts by awaiting params
- [x] Added admin authentication to src/app/create-blog/page.tsx to prevent unauthorized blog creation
- [x] Added admin authentication to src/app/edit-blog/[id]/page.tsx to prevent unauthorized blog editing
- [x] Added CSS styles for login forms in src/app/create-blog/page.module.css

## Summary
1. **Fixed toString() Error**: The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')" was occurring because the code was trying to call toString() on blog._id and blog.imageId without checking if they were defined. Added defensive filters to skip blogs where these fields are missing or null.

2. **Fixed Next.js 15 Params Issue**: Updated the API route to await params before destructuring, as required by Next.js 15.

3. **Secured Admin Routes**: Added password-based authentication to both create-blog and edit-blog routes to prevent unauthorized access. Users must enter the admin password to access these features.

## Next Steps
- Test the /blogs route to confirm the error is resolved
- Test the create-blog and edit-blog routes to ensure authentication works properly
- If needed, investigate why some blogs might have missing _id or imageId in the database
