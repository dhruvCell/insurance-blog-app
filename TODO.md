# TODO: Fix Error on /blogs Route

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated src/components/BlogSearch.tsx to filter out blogs with missing _id or imageId before calling toString()
- [x] Updated src/app/page.tsx to filter out blogs with missing _id or imageId before calling toString()

## Summary
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')" was occurring because the code was trying to call toString() on blog._id and blog.imageId without checking if they were defined. Added defensive filters to skip blogs where these fields are missing or null.

## Next Steps
- Test the /blogs route to confirm the error is resolved
- If needed, investigate why some blogs might have missing _id or imageId in the database
